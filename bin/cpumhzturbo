# Program:   cpumhzturbo
#
# Purpose:   Show a summary of CPUs frequencies *when busy* (in C0-state and not idle),
#            in somewhat tricky units of MHz, grouped by 100MHz increments.
#
# Notes:     You need sudo/root access for this tool as turbostat requires it (setcap
#            is also possible)
#
# Important: This script does not show how "fast" your CPUs ran during the entire measurement
#            interval, only when they happened to be not idle! (man turbostat to read more
#            about Bzy_MHz meaning.
#
#            For actual CPU "busyness" view at low level, you should run cpuwrkturbo
#            or turbostat directly (or use perf stat -d to dig deeper into the CPUs)

# As this script needs to be ran as root (with sudo), /usr/bin might not be in root's path
TURBOSTAT=/usr/bin/turbostat

# turbostat requires root
if [ "$USER" != root ]; then
    echo "Error: This script uses turbostat which requires root privs. Run sudo $0" >&2
